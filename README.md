## Features

#### Gaggle is aimed to replicate the same user experience just like Google. To start this project, the first issue I encountered is to find any mock data or free API so that I could fetch data, filter and present them on the webpage. Without much efforts, I replicated the Google-like layout and theme with Tailwind CSS.

A few hightlights:

- Darkmode

- Mobile-ready responsive design

- Option to choose display count
